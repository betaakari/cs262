# CS 262 - Lab 3

## Project Management: GitHub

This lab focused on learning how to use **Git** and **GitHub** for both individual and team projects.

---

## Personal Repository

- My personal repo: [https://github.com/betaakari/cs262](https://github.com/betaakari/cs262)
- I successfully pushed **lab01** and **lab02** here.
- The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude `node_modules/` and other unnecessary files.

## Team GitHub Organization

- **Organization Name:** calvin-cs262-fall2025-teamG  
- **Repos:**
  - [Client](https://github.com/calvin-cs262-fall2025-teamG/Client)
  - [Project](https://github.com/calvin-cs262-fall2025-teamG/Project)
  - [Service](https://github.com/calvin-cs262-fall2025-teamG/Service)

Each repo has been successfully cloned locally and connected to the team organization.

## Collaboration Test

To verify GitHub collaboration:
1. Each team member created a **temp branch** (e.g., `temp/betaakari`).
2. Added a simple file (e.g., `betaakari.txt`).
3. Created a **pull request** and merged it into `main`.

This confirmed that the team repos are functioning properly for shared development.


## Reflection

In this lab, we learned:
- How to use Git commands (`clone`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `branch`, `merge`)
- How to collaborate using **pull requests**
- The difference between personal and team repositories
- How GitHub helps manage software projects efficiently
