# CS 262 - Lab 2

## Project Management

## Tools Setup

### Trello
We created our team Trello board at:  
👉 [trello.com/b/your-board-link](https://trello.com/b/your-board-link)

Each column is organized as follows:

- **Backlog** – Future tasks  
- **Sprint 1: Doing** – Current work  
- **Sprint 1: Done** – Completed tasks

---

### Slack
Our team communicates through Slack at:  
👉 [teamg.slack.com](https://teamg.slack.com)

Channels:

- **#general** – announcements and updates  
- **#random** – fun or casual chat  
- **#grading** – questions for instructors

---

### Clockify
We use Clockify for time tracking:  
👉 [clockify.me](https://clockify.me)

Each team member logs hours for all meetings, coding sessions, and team discussions.

## Team Notes

- **Team Name:** Team G  
- **Members:** Brynn, Rose, Simon, Maham  
- **Project Idea:** *Hey Neighbor* — an app designed for college students to borrow and lend materials such as textbooks, vacuums, and other useful items. The goal is to make campus life easier, save money, and encourage sharing within the student community.

## Reflection
In this lab, we learned how to organize our project using **Trello**, communicate effectively with **Slack**, and track progress through **Clockify**. Setting up these tools helped our team coordinate tasks and understand how project management works in real software development environments.
